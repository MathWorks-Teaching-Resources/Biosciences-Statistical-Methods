This curriculum module uses biological data to teach fundamental concepts of statistics, data analysis, and data visualization. 

## Description

This module will teach students how to use statistical methods in MATLAB&reg; to analyze ecologically relevant data. We will explore the data using descriptive statistics, fit the data using a predictive model, find the linear correlations between variables, and finally, discuss how to test a hypothesis.Make sure you're familiar with the basics of using MATLAB by going through the [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) before continuing. We also recommend reviewing the Biosciences Data module. 

This module utilizes the Palmer penguins [1] dataset, which contains data about three different species of penguin in Antarctica.

## Prerequisites 

This module assumes basic MATLAB knowledge and it is recommended that all students take the  [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) and go through the related Biosciences Data curriculum module. 

## Getting Started 

To learn more about opening and using MATLAB, see the accompanying [Getting Started](Getting_Started.pdf) guide. 

## Sections 
Notes: These scripts can all be run independently, though we recommend going through these live scripts in order. These live scripts are intended to be used with output inline. To change the output, go to the View tab of the toolstrip, and select ![](Images/outputinline.png)  Output Inline. 
The scripts have areas for the students to interact with the code ![](Images/try.png) . There will also be exercises ![](Images/exercise.png)  in most scripts and the answers will be provided at the end.  A problem set for students to practice these concepts is also included here. Throughout the scripts, there are also moments to students to reflect on what they've learned or on what the data means ![](Images/reflect.png) . Particularly interesting examples of how these concepts are used in "real-world" biology are also pointed out ![](Images/app.png).
